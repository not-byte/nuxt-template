### About

The goal is to create innovative solutions in digital services, data security, scalability, and
interoperability.

<p id="web3"></p>
Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts
such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.

Our challenge is to develop a canister on the Internet Computer that addresses one or more problems
described in the
contest project. We have chosen to create a DApp with a communication system.

### Requirements (Met!)

- [x] A public project on GitHub with complete code
- [x] A detailed project description in the README file
- [x] A short presentation of the idea (maximum 3 minutes)

### Version

First release 1.0.0-BETA

For our backend service we have chosen **Rust** ü¶Ä as Message provider with it‚Äôs memory safety and blazingly fast üöÄ
computing.

In creating interface **TypeScript** and **Vue.js** helped us the most, with addition of TailwindCSS for styling and
Vite,
Docker for deployment, so we can launch our project to at any time!
